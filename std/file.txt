It was long, long ago when the Fox and the Crane were close friends.
One fine day the Fox invited the Crane to dinner with her and said to him:
«Come, buddy! Come, my dear! I’ll treat you heartily!”
And so the Crane came to the Fox for the dinner party. 
The Fox had cooked semolina for the dinner and smeared it over the plate. 
Then she served it and treated her guest. +-0_/n
“Help yourself to tasty dinner, my dear godfather. That was me who cooked it!”
The Crane went peck-peck with his beak, knocked and knocked but couldn’t pick even a bit of fare. 
The Fox kept licking the cereal until she had eaten it all. -(0)+
